<h1>Console Web App</h1>

<p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for 
development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick 
code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller 
featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>

<p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in
 Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer
and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in 
hardware text mode.</p>
